# A year of recovery from my Lisfranc fracture using data viz and moving average 

# Project description

Inception: You can find a more complete story of my left foot odessey on the [Medium post](https://link-url-here.org)


Data type: time series

Methods: moving average, data viz

Tools: Python3 


- data I used

What your application does,
Why you used the technologies you used,
Some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future.



# How to run the project using step data
## Files included
- /data folder to put in the dataset
- StepAnalysis.ipynb : script where I visualize my step data
- apple-health-data-parser.py : this script is from [Markwk/qs_ledger repo](https://github.com/markwk/qs_ledger) and unmodified.


## Github reps I used to prepare the Health data
### Potential issues
First time I exported my data from Health, there was an error with two parsers I used, it turned out it was a bug from the app export. I just updated my iOS and reexported the data from the app and the parser worked.

## Python packages needed


# How to use the project
## You can use fork and use the jupyter notebook for any time series data, where you need to use moving average



# Credits
To parse and perform data prep, I used and was inspired by [Markwk/qs_ledger repo](https://github.com/markwk/qs_ledger)
